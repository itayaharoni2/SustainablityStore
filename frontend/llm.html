    <h1>Code Generated by LLM</h1>
    <p>In the development of this project, an LLM was used to generate the following parts of the application:</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Carbon Footprint Calculator</h2>
        <p>
            The LLM provided the initial implementation for the Carbon Footprint Calculator, 
            including the form fields and the logic to calculate a user's carbon footprint based on inputted daily activities like driving and electricity use.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Water Usage Calculator</h2>
        <p>
            The Water Usage Calculator page was also generated by the LLM. 
            This includes the form that calculates water consumption based on user-provided data, like minutes spent showering and the number of dishes washed, and the logic to display the result.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Products Page</h2>
        <p>
            The LLM helped with the implementation of the Products page, with the structure of every individual page.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Learn More Page (Text Content)</h2>
        <p>
            The descriptive text on the “Learn More” page was generated by the LLM. It explains the benefits of sustainable living and provides tips and information on how users can reduce their environmental impact.
