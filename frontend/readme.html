            Our store offers a variety of sustainable and eco-friendly products aimed at reducing environmental impact.

        <h2>What was hard to do?</h2>
        <p>
            The frontend was particularly challenging, especially as it was my first time using React and designing a proper website. I spent a lot of time on the design because it really bothered me when things didn't look right. 
            Also, when we started the project, I was in Mexico, and my partner was in Israel. We decided to split the work, with me handling the frontend and him the backend. 
            However, this created communication issues, and I didn’t understand big parts of his code, and he didn’t understand mine. 
            After we realized this method wasn’t working, we switched to working together via screen sharing. Although the different time zones still made things difficult, this approach worked better.

        <h2>Who is your partner? What did you do? What did your partner do?</h2>
        <p>
            My partner is <strong>Michael Ohayon</strong>, ID: 319019291. Initially, we divided the work into frontend (me) and backend (Michael), but most of the time, we ended up working together because dividing the work wasn't effective.

        <h2>Database Information</h2>
        <p>
            We are using SQLite as the database with Prisma ORM to make queries. The database file is named "dev.db." I recently realized it should be called "persist.js," but I left it as is to avoid losing data. I hope this isn’t a problem.
